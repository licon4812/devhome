// LibGit2Sharp.CommitEnumerator are not reusable as they do not provide a way to reuse libgit2's revwalk object
// LibGit2's prepare_walk() does the expensive work of traversing and caching the commit graph
// Unfortunately LibGit2Sharp.CommitEnumerator.Reset() method resets the revwalk, but does not reinitialize the sort/push/hide options
// This leaves all that work wasted only to be done again.
// Furthermore, LibGit2 revwalk initialization takes locks on internal data, which causes contention in multithreaded scenarios as threads
// all scramble to initialize and re-initialize their own revwalk objects.
// Ideally, LibGit2Sharp improves the API to allow reusing the revwalk object, but that seems unlikely to happen soon.
